# Mean, Var, and Std

## Problem Description
mean
The mean tool computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.
By default, the axis is None. Therefore, it computes the mean of the flattened array.
var
The var tool computes the arithmetic variance along the specified axis.
By default, the axis is None. Therefore, it computes the variance of the flattened array.
std
The std tool computes the arithmetic standard deviation along the specified axis.
By default, the axis is None. Therefore, it computes the standard deviation of the flattened array.
Task
You are given a 2-D array of size X. 
Your task is to find:
Input Format
The first line contains the space separated values of  and . 
The next  lines contains  space separated integers.
Output Format
First, print the mean. 
Second, print the var. 
Third, print the std.
