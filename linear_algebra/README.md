# Linear Algebra

## Problem Description
The NumPy module also comes with a number of built-in routines for linear algebra calculations. These can be found in the sub-module linalg.
linalg.det
The linalg.det tool computes the determinant of an array.
linalg.eig
The linalg.eig computes the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square array.
linalg.inv
The linalg.inv tool computes the (multiplicative) inverse of a matrix.
Other routines can be found here
