# Arrays

## Problem Description
The NumPy (Numeric Python) package helps us manipulate large arrays and matrices of numeric data.
To use the NumPy module, we need to import it using:
Arrays
A NumPy array is a grid of values. They are similar to lists, except that every element of an array must be the same type.
In the above example, numpy.array() is used to convert a list into a NumPy array. The second argument (float) can be used to set the type of array elements.
Task
You are given a space separated list of numbers. 
Your task is to print a reversed NumPy array with the element type float.
Input Format
A single line of input containing space separated numbers.
Output Format
Print the reverse NumPy array with type float.
