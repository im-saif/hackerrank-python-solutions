# Write a function

## Problem Description
An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day.  It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun.  A leap year contains a leap day.
In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.  Source
Task
Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year.  If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.
Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function.  It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.
Input Format
Read , the year to test.
Constraints

Output Format
The function must return a Boolean value (True/False).  Output is handled by the provided code stub.
Sample Input 0
Sample Output 0
Explanation 0
1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap year.

## Example Input/Output
### Sample Input 0
```
1990
